Re:ID# C00003251, Request for Additional Information - Amended March Monthly Report (02/01/2018 ï¿½ 02/28/2018) 

Dear Mr. Morse,

We are in receipt of your Request for Additional Information (RFAI) dated May 2, 2018. While your letter 
acknowledged that we did provide an explanation about the disbursements disclosed on our amended 
March Monthly Report,you requested additional clarification. We welcome the opportunity to further 
clarify for the Commission and the public record our on-going efforts to file accurate reports.

NEA Fund for Children and Public Education seeks to comply with all federal, state and local campaign 
finance regulations as applicable based on our activity. We work with our vendor to insure timely and 
accurate filings. To that end, a monthly reconciliation of the PAC bank account showed that - due
to a previously undetected administrative error - there were disbursements made in February, 2018 that were not
reported on the March Monthly report. The report containing the error was promptly amended and we have taken steps with our
vendor to ensure that such and occurrence does not happen again.
 
We trust that this letter adequately responds to your inquiry. If you have any further questions, please 
contact us.
 

Respectfully submitted,

Michael McPherson
Treasurer
NEA Fund for Children and Public Education
